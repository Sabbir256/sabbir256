  Software Engineer<br/>

<p align="left">
A seasoned software engineer with 3 years of hands-on experience. I deal with things like building the backbones of web applications, managing data in the cloud, and making websites look good and work smoothly.

During my software engineering career, I have worked with multiple programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and technologies such as Java(Apex), Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, React, Postgres, AngularJS, and AWS.

My interests range from distributed systems and big data to AI. I'm constantly driven to push my boundaries and explore new technological horizons.

Outside of work, I'm deeply committed to personal growth and self-improvement.</br> 
I firmly believe in the power of continuous learning, both professionally and personally.<br/>
In my downtime, you will find me lost in the pages of a captivating book 📚 or listening to podcasts 🎙️
